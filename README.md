# Weather Station

The purpose of this app is to monitor air pressure. Recently I started to have a lot of headaches, and I decided to create a simple weather station based in raspberry pi and bme280 sensor.

## requirements
- raspberry pi
- bme280 sensor (its bosh originally but plenty of similar on the market)
- telegram bot (to get data from weather station)
- postgres (to store data)
- wkhtmltopdf (to get pdf graphs with air pressure)
- golang (obviously)
